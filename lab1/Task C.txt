1. Are h1 and h2 admissible?
    h1: The number of moves needed to solve the puzzle is at least the number of misplaced tiles.
    This functions as a minimum lower boundary for the number of turns needed to solve the puzzle,
    thus it will never overestimate the cost of solving the puzzle and is therefore admissable.

    h2: The manhattan distance. The sum of the movements needed for each tile to reach its correct position
    is once again a lower bound of the mimimum turns required to solve the puzzle and is therefore admissable.

2. Which heuristic among h1 and h2 performs better, and why?
    h2 performs better because it contains more information. Although both heuristics are scalars,
    h2 is built on each individual tile's displacement and not the puzzle overall displacement. This
    gives the heuristic a more accurate estimation of the minimum turns needed to solve the puzzle.
    E.g: A state where tile 3 is in position 7 and everything else is correct. h1 gives the value 1 and h2 gives 4.
    h1 gives the impression that the puzzle is close to being solved even though it isn't. Therefore, h2 gives 
    a more representative value of the state the puzzle is in.

3. Which of the following heuristics are admissible?
h3 = (h1+h2)/2
    Since both h1 and h2 are admissable, their mean is too, since the mean can never be larger than the maximum of the values.

h4 = 2Ã—h1 - Inadmissable
    | 1 2 3 |
    | 4 5 6 |
    |   7 8 |
    h4 = 2*2 = 4 since tiles 7 and 8 are displaced but the puzzle can be solved in two turns, therefore the 
    heuristic overestimates and is inadmissable.

h5 = max(h1,h2)
    Since both h1 and h2 are admissable, choosing either one of them will be an admissable heuristic as well.
